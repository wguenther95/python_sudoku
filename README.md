# Python Sudoku Application

Simple Sudoku game utilizing backtracking algorithm to generate boards of differing difficulty. 

### Description
----------------
This project was built with the intention of exploring backtracking algorithms and recursion. Sudoku is a classic example where recursion can be used to efficiently solve the game. Backtracking algorithms were implemented, not just for checking user input, but also for generating new Sudoku boards of differing difficulty, and verifying that they are indeed solveable.
