# Python Sudoku Application

Simple Sudoku game with GUI, utilizing backtracking algorithm to create games of multiple difficulties. 

### Description
----------------
This project was built with the intention of exploring backtracking algorithms and recursion. Sudoku is a classic example where recursion can be used to efficiently solve the game. Backtracking algorithms were implemented, not just for checking user input, but also for generating new Sudoku boards of differing difficulty, and verifying that they are indeed solveable.

This project was written in Python 3.7, and the GUI was written using the popular Python wrapper for Qt, PyQt5. An image of the GUI interface is shown below.
